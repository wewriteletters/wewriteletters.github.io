<p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Dear Evan, </span></p>
<p class="c1">
  <span class="c0"
    >How are you? It&rsquo;s cruel that we&rsquo;re in the same geographic swath
    of land for the first time since high school but a pandemic prevents us from
    meeting. Geography means nothing and everything now. The minute kind</span
  ><span class="c8">&mdash;</span
  ><span class="c0"
    >Reprise Coffee, the outdoor market on Broadway, all the shuttered bars on
    Howard</span
  ><span class="c8">&mdash;</span
  ><span class="c0"
    >have been nullified. I miss these small places and their associated small
    memories, and while we wait for the world to safely begin churning again,
    I&rsquo;d like to share one small memory with you. It happened at the Folger
    Theater.
  </span>
</p>
<p class="c1 c2">
  <span class="c0"
    >I discovered The Folger Theater far too late into my time in DC. To be
    fair, DC was barely a city to me when I was in it. &nbsp;I was suffering
    from my first (and currently only) brisk with a breakup and the city was the
    setting for a kind of malaise more than it was an actual place. Snippets of
    memory come to me and some of them are sweet or funny or exciting, but there
    is a veneer of feeling terrible that surrounds that entire summer.
    It&rsquo;s unavoidable, I suppose.
  </span>
</p>
<p class="c1 c2">
  <span class="c3 c0"
    >And yet, as I think of my favorite anecdotes from places, DC pops up first.
    Not all of my memories in the city. Not the walking through downtown and
    discovering I was crying before I felt the heaving in my chest. Not the late
    night conversations with my roommate or going out for drinks with my
    coworkers. But there is a place in DC where my memories are crisp and new:
    The Folger Theater.
  </span>
</p>
<p class="c1 c2">
  <span class="c0"
    >I never saw a performance at The Folger. This is my first confession. I was
    there with a childhood friend one summer day. I met this friend on my first
    day of third grade, </span
  ><span class="c0"
    >when I was still telling people I was from Connecticut because at that time
    I still was,</span
  ><span class="c3 c0"
    >&nbsp;and we became close quickly. After all, we satisfied each
    other&rsquo;s needs for: 1) wanting a friend, any friend, and 2) liking
    Pok&eacute;mon. We stopped going to the same school after fifth grade, and
    so we are attached at the root but are strange to each other as well. It is
    an odd but wonderful friendship.
  </span>
</p>
<p class="c1 c2">
  <span class="c3 c0"
    >This friend had come to my aide (along with her mother) when she heard that
    I was &ldquo;doing okay, by most measures&rdquo; (I was doing terribly).
    Recognizing the signs of my morose temperament at its worst, she shuffled
    her mother and herself onto a plane.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="c1 c2">
  <span class="c0"
    >One of the hot, humid days my friend was visiting, I was trying to show her
    around the city. She is not the adventuring type, but she humored me. We ate
    food together. I played a video game at her hotel before excusing myself to
    go home and cry. We ate food together again. And finally I, desperate to be
    more hospitable, dragged her onto the metro. I walked her around the Senate
    and House buildings (if she was going to be in DC she should at least see
    them, I reasoned) and as we walked in concentric circles from that
    legislative nexus I stumbled across the Folger Theater. I made quick work of
    inventing a reason for us to enter. My friend loved to read. I loved to read
    too, but she was the novelist between us. Fantasy worlds were more real to
    her and more important to her than our own sometimes. We needed a respite
    from the hot sun and I needed an excuse to </span
  ><span class="c0 c7">do something</span
  ><span class="c0">, so I took this small piece of evidence</span
  ><span class="c8">&mdash;</span
  ><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;my friend likes fiction&rdquo;</span
  ><span class="c8">&mdash;</span
  ><span class="c3 c0"
    >&nbsp;and supposed that she would be interested in seeing and learning
    about the works of the Bard. She, kindly, agreed (I would find out later
    that she was rather indifferent to Shakespeare).</span
  >
</p>
<p class="c1 c2">
  <span class="c0"
    >We entered the Folger Shakespeare Library. The current exhibit was small
    and devoid of purveyors, but there was a ready and excited woman with beaded
    glasses and </span
  ><span class="c0">shorn</span
  ><span class="c3 c0"
    >&nbsp;grey hair stationed at its mouth like some kind of mythic guardian.
    She beckoned us over, swinging her hands back and forth to the beat of
    silence.
  </span>
</p>
<p class="c1 c2">
  <span class="c0"
    >Her hands wound wildly around her now, as we were told so much about
    Shakespeare so incredibly quickly. Part biography, part drama, part literary
    analysis, I was in awe of her talent. Yet, I regret that this is not what I
    remember from that day. In my heat-stricken </span
  ><span class="c0">malaise</span
  ><span class="c3 c0"
    >&nbsp;I could barely pay attention and so I let my neurons fizzle out
    slowly, nodding at this sage with intent while not hearing a word of what
    she so carefully said. &nbsp;</span
  >
</p>
<p class="c1 c2">
  <span class="c0"
    >I knew I had made a mistake when the woman, gazing at me, let her voice
    swoop up at the end of a sentence. A </span
  ><span class="c0 c7">question</span
  ><span class="c3 c0"
    >. One my friend would not answer, because she did not answer questions (I
    took that role early on in our friendship, but I had forgotten my place. We
    were not asked questions often when we were together). Caught inattentive
    and stupid, I pointed to a sign I saw as my salvation. It said that there
    were rehearsals going on and that if we were very, very quiet, we could
    watch them. Our guide graciously accepted my negligence and pointed me to a
    door. She told us there was a tight spiral stone staircase there that we
    could climb to the theater.
  </span>
</p>
<p class="c1 c2">
  <span class="c3 c0"
    >When we finally entered the rehearsal space, we walked onto the balcony.
    The stage was so bright below us it hurt to look at it. This is where my
    memory sharpens. The man speaking was young. He had tight locks of hair. He
    was wearing a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles T-Shirt, and he was scowling at
    an older man to his right. This man was laughing. His hair was gray. There
    was a script in his hand he sheepishly referred to as he gave a glib retort
    back in iambic pentameter.
  </span>
</p>
<p class="c1 c2">
  <span class="c3 c0"
    >I looked at my friend with glee and she responded with an accommodating
    smile. A woman with glasses strode up on stage and repositioned the young
    man&rsquo;s body so we could see more of it. She joked with the older man.
    She motioned to two young women on the sidelines to take their places and
    began talking about the playwright&rsquo;s intent. Everyone listened
    gravely, and I tried to make myself as small as possible to avoid detection.
    It felt as if we should not be here, despite the sign at the door. I felt
    like a child, and hunched my back so severely so that only my eyes peeked
    out over the seat in front of me.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="c1 c2">
  <span class="c0"
    >The figures on stage re-arranged themselves so the young man with the
    T</span
  ><span class="c0">urtles</span
  ><span class="c0"
    >&nbsp;shirt was in a position I could only describe as </span
  ><span class="c0 c7">basking</span
  ><span class="c0"
    >&nbsp;on the floor. A woman with long black hair in a white dress sat down
    behind him, poking at his head so he would lift it up and place it in her
    lap. They settled, intertwined. Two other actors, a couple, wrapped each
    other in their arms nearby. The actors began to giggle, aware of the
    awkwardness of their play intimacy</span
  ><span class="c0">.</span
  ><span class="c3 c0"
    >&nbsp;The laughter halted and instructions were given. A scene played.
    Lovers teased each other. Old men sent young men off to war. A woman sang in
    Welsh so beautifully I thought my fragile psyche would goad me to tears.
  </span>
</p>
<p class="c1 c2">
  <span class="c3 c0"
    >Every few moments, the woman with glasses would motion for things to begin
    again. Or she would move an arm, a leg, a face, to the light. The
    actor&rsquo;s bodies would become more solid as each iteration progressed,
    as if she was forming them with her suggestions.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="c1 c2">
  <span class="c0"
    >The repetitive nature of this acting or play-acting was beautiful to me. A
    line would be half formed and suddenly an actor would shake their head,
    tired of themselves, and look to the others for help. Suggestions would be
    offered, some seeming more helpful than others, and then they would start
    again. </span
  ><span class="c0"
    >If I was lucky, the director would hop onto the stage and move a face
    skyward or act a line herself. She would ask questions about the source
    material that came off as deeply philosophical to me such as: &ldquo;How is
    love shown in the body?&rdquo; As the actors curved their own bodies around
    each other at the director&rsquo;s discretion, her question remained with
    me. Against my will I began to catalog smiles (tired, loving, forced),
    kisses (quick, long, forced), and gestures of love only expressed in sleep
    (reaching out to hold me as I tried to leave the bed, a murmur of my name,
    the folding of a body into mine so gentle that I could not move my arm even
    if it was deprived of blood). </span
  ><span class="c0 c7">How is love shown in a body? </span
  ><span class="c0">Where does it go after the body is gone?</span>
</p>
<p class="c1 c2">
  <span class="c0">&ldquo;You are leaving her. She sings. She sings </span
  ><span class="c0 c7">for you</span
  ><span class="c0"
    >!&rdquo; the director said. I watched her actor mime variants of grief on
    his face until he had found one that she approved of, and I marvelled. How
    he had isolated the faces of pain, of personal betrayal, of resignation to
    fate so swiftly! </span
  ><span class="c0"
    >I wish I could have saved those faces for later. I did not want them to
    spoil waiting on shelves to be used.</span
  ><span class="c0"
    >&nbsp;I quickly found that this young man was the best actor of the group
    at harvesting emotion for the banquet of theater. Other actors turned their
    faces away from the audience to practice, or took a deep breath to steel
    themselves. These were understandable preparations, but marked them as
    amateurs. And yet, each man or woman on stage would slip into their own
    talent. Every time I was serenaded in Welsh I almost cried when the
    actress&rsquo; voice twisted around my ears like ribbons. It was so light
    and gentle. I was afraid that she might break her voice if she gave this
    gift so freely. Every time the older man, playing a military officer of some
    kind, would look up from his map with cynicism that sweetened to envy of the
    young lovers cooing and laughing, I wanted to wave my hands. I wanted to
    tell him that I understood him. </span
  ><span class="c0">I did not. </span>
</p>
<p class="c1 c2">
  <span class="c0">The director put her hands together, letting a </span
  ><span class="c0">&nbsp;sharp clap cut</span
  ><span class="c0"
    >&nbsp;through the theater. The actors suddenly collapsed out of character.
    Their bodies morphed into something familiar, and they began discussing
    normal things like: </span
  ><span class="c0 c7">What was wrong with the panini press this time? </span
  ><span class="c0">and </span
  ><span class="c0 c7"
    >Oh, isn&rsquo;t DC so hot in the summer? I can&rsquo;t bear this city. </span
  ><span class="c3 c0"
    >I let my spine curve into the back of my seat, and suddenly remembered I
    had come to this theater with someone else. I swung my head around to look
    at my friend, nervous that she would appear irritated, or worse, that she
    had committed to resign to this entertainment for my benefit. Her eyes were
    fixed on the actors below, and her face turned to mine with a satisfied
    sigh. She was smiling.
  </span>
</p>
<p class="c1 c2">
  <span class="c0"
    >This friend is not much for words, at least the spoken kind. When we used
    to go to movies when we were younger, I would bolt into the light of the
    mall AMC with still-greasy popcorn fingers ready to dissect our film </span
  ><span class="c0">like it was a patient etherized upon a table</span
  ><span class="c3 c0"
    >. My friend, upon a barrage of questions, would nod, or shake her head.
    When I finally relented from the specific queries on symbology and
    cinematography and asked her simply how she thought the movie had gone, she
    would usually utter no words, but would give me sounds. An assenting sound
    here. A begrudging huff there. Only if she had strong feelings she would
    say: &ldquo;It was good,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;
  </span>
</p>
<p class="c1 c2">
  <span class="c0"
    >She was not any more verbose in the Folger Theater, but her smile and the
    fact that she remained stuck to her seat was evidence enough for me. We were
    enjoying something together. </span
  ><span class="c0"
    >We would never know what we were both getting out of it, but it was
    something holy and important.</span
  ><span class="c3 c0"
    >&nbsp;Another clap. The rehearsal resumed. We only left after we were both
    infected with a blush of decency as we realized that we were alone in the
    spectator stands and had been for nearly two hours. My friend&rsquo;s mother
    would ask for us soon. As I left I succumbed to the strange impulse to
    inhale as much of the air in that theater as I could into my lungs. I knew
    this was foolish, as foolish as a child trying to capture and hold a
    butterfly in her hands forever (though, admittedly, I did this frequently as
    a child).
  </span>
</p>
<p class="c1 c2">
  <span class="c0"
    >It was hot and humid and suffocating outside of the theater. I thought
    about love and bodies and the power of repetition and where we would eat
    dinner. I </span
  ><span class="c0">did</span
  ><span class="c0"
    >&nbsp;not know what my friend thought about. We walked in silence to the
    metro station, and we did not break the quiet until the train careened south
    towards Virginia. My friend is a picky eater. We got pizza, something she
    always liked if it came with black olives, for dinner. Her mother joined us,
    and we did not tell her what we did that day. It would be too hard to
    explain, and we would have to give two different accounts that would only
    confuse. Instead we complained about the heat, talked about entering our
    senior years of college, and stated that the pizza was unequivocally good.
    Reliably delicious and drenched in grease. Reliably </span
  ><span class="c0">unfantastical</span><span class="c0">. </span
